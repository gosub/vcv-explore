# VCV Rack patches

## cptnal drone n.1 - 2020-03-15

Drone patch inspired by [a post by cptnal on muffwiggler](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3121475#p3121475): "You have two pairs of oscillators and each is tuned to the note of a chord. Each pair goes to a crossfader, wavefolder, and filter. Modulate each of these very slowly and there's your drone"

A patch composed of three voices:
- rings ->  drive  -> portland weather
- trummor is the bassdrum
- palm loop as a pad

A slow square lfo scans the wavetable in macro oscillator and triggers the s&h that changes the note played, unquantized. The ping-pong delay adds some ambience.  Try changing the ping-pong rate for a cool effect.
