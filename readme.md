## cptnal drone n.1 - 2020-03-15

Drone patch inspired by [a post by cptnal on muffwiggler](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3121475#p3121475): "You have two pairs of oscillators and each is tuned to the note of a chord. Each pair goes to a crossfader, wavefolder, and filter. Modulate each of these very slowly and there's your drone"

## palms in portland - 2020-03-16

A patch composed of three voices:
- rings ->  drive  -> portland weather
- trummor is the bassdrum
- palm loop as a pad

A slow square lfo scans the wavetable in macro oscillator and triggers the s&h that changes the note played, unquantized. The ping-pong delay adds some ambience.  Try changing the ping-pong rate for a cool effect.

 A reinterpretation of [Comparative Irrelevance's Three Module Challenge #25, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xz87QkFaqo).
 Here I simulate Mutable Instruments Ears by touching my laptop's integrated mic. The inverted gate is from NYSTHI NyEnvFollower, with positive offset and negative scale. This gate is used to disengage Clouds' freeze when audio is over a certain threshold. You will probably have to play with the scale and offset to match your setup. The rest of the patch is the infamous Rings into Clouds :) Watch [Comparative Irrelevance's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xz87QkFaqo) for more info and inspiration.

## a minor arraign - 2020-06-15

Glitch producing patch. LFO, ADDR-SEQ and FM-OP are the sound source, a simple 4 notes sequence. Audio input for DELAY is alternatingly switched between audio and feedback, full wet and with no internal feedback. The same clock changes the delay time with a S&H. Audio output is attenuated and filtered.

## overmorrow - 2020-06-21

A generative fm drum patch. Bleak is the modulator, VCO-3340 is the carrier. the drum pattern in programmed with NYSTHI dual five step. Every 32 clock ticks, the oscillators and the modulator envelope are randomized with stoermelder STRIP.

## gorgon bimester - 2020-06-28

A very basic four voice drum machine.

## echistica - 2020-06-29

Rampage is used as a pulse generator. The pulse is bandpassed to band-limit the signal, then delay and reverb are applied. A dual S&H randomizes the filter frequency and the pulse fall time. The sound of human settlement.
