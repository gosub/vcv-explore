## cptnal drone n.1 - 2020-03-15

Drone patch inspired by [a post by cptnal on muffwiggler](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3121475#p3121475): "You have two pairs of oscillators and each is tuned to the note of a chord. Each pair goes to a crossfader, wavefolder, and filter. Modulate each of these very slowly and there's your drone"

## palms in portland - 2020-03-16

A patch composed of three voices:
- rings ->  drive  -> portland weather
- trummor is the bassdrum
- palm loop as a pad

A slow square lfo scans the wavetable in macro oscillator and triggers the s&h that changes the note played, unquantized. The ping-pong delay adds some ambience.  Try changing the ping-pong rate for a cool effect.

 A reinterpretation of [Comparative Irrelevance's Three Module Challenge #25, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xz87QkFaqo).
 Here I simulate Mutable Instruments Ears by touching my laptop's integrated mic. The inverted gate is from NYSTHI NyEnvFollower, with positive offset and negative scale. This gate is used to disengage Clouds' freeze when audio is over a certain threshold. You will probably have to play with the scale and offset to match your setup. The rest of the patch is the infamous Rings into Clouds :) Watch [Comparative Irrelevance's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xz87QkFaqo) for more info and inspiration.
