Detuned saws modulated with three lfos.

## frantume 002 - 2020-10-04

Four VCO-2 slightly detuned via three BGA LLFO. The longest lfo also modulates the
lowest oscillator wave. A modulated Delay and some XFX Reverb are thrown in the mix
for some ambience.

**Addressable Quad Cascading Attack-Hold Envelope**

This is a very simple Prototype script, but I couldnâ€™t find a module in the library that does this.
The raise of knob 1 is spread between four outputs, in cascade. For example:

- KNOB 1 between 0 and 1/4: output 1 goes from 0 to 10v, and stays there
- KNOB 1 between 1/4 and 1/2: output 2 goes from 0 to 10v, and stays there
- KNOB 1 between 1/2 and 3/4: output 3 goes from 0 to 10v, and stays there
- KNOB 1 between 3/4 and 1: output 4 goes from 0 to 10v

## frantume 006 - 2020-10-18

Two piano voices: one plays the high notes, the other the low notes.

## frantume 007 - 2020-10-28
