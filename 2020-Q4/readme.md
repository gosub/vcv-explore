# VCV Rack patches - 2020-Q4

## frantume 001 - 2020-10-03

Detuned saws modulated with three lfos.

## frantume 002 - 2020-10-04

Four VCO-2 slightly detuned via three BGA LLFO. The longest lfo also modulates the
lowest oscillator wave. A modulated Delay and some XFX Reverb are thrown in the mix
for some ambience.

## frantume 003 - 2020-10-09

MSM Dual Delay takes us to hell and back.
